#Part 1: Create a BSTNode class

#Part 2: Create a BST class
  #Part 3: Add functionality to your BST class


#If the tree is empty (root points to None), put the new node at the top of the tree.
    #If the tree is not empty, start at the root. 
    #Compare the new node's value to the current node's value. 
        #If the new node is bigger, move to the right. 
        #If the new node's value is smaller, move to the left. 
        #When there is no node at the current position, put the new node there.
